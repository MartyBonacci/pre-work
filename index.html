        <p>Git is version control software on your computer.</p>
        <p>We COMMIT our code versions to git on our computer.</p>
        <p>Github.com is a cloud service that works with git to help us collaborate and share our code with others.</p>
        <p>We PUSH our code to github.com.</p>
        <p>We DEPLOY our projects to a server so that the world can view them in a browser on a computer, tablet or phone.</p>
        <p>In the bootcamp we DEPLOY to the bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu server</p>
        <p>DEPLOY and PUSH are DIFFERENT!!!</p>
